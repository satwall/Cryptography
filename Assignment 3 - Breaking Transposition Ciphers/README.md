I'll briefly go over each folder and the contents inside. 

Do not move the location of any of the files inside the Source folder except if you want to remove the included FileInput.txt file or add your own. 

Documents contains the documentation of the files
Source contains the script used to break the cipher, Transposition_BruteForce.py, as well as the scripts provided which include detectEnglish.py, trdecode.py, trencode.py and dictionary.txt. 
Videos contains a voice-over demostration overview as well as a runthrough of each test conducted. 

In order to run the script, go to 'Source' and run the Transposition_BruteForce.py in your terminal of choice. 
You'll be asked whether you want to provide a file, or if you want to manually input the cipher. I've included an FileInput.txt file which I used for testing for convinence but you can simply delete it and use your own file. 
It will run the program and provide you with a potential key and plaintext, where you can decide whether you want to continue (Y) or end the script (N).
